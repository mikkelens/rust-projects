10 more bullets inspiration/notes
- camera shake for significant hits (explosions)
- explosions make a sound effect
- there are (gold) ships that are not affected by causal bullets (only direct hits?)
which makes you wonder how/why to hit them. they are also a direct risk since they can occupy grabbers?
- small ships have a chance to drop timed effects
- bigger ships are (basically) guarantees with effect drops
- you can always see how many bullets you have left so you know what you are trying to conserve
- grabbers cannot grab everything, makes you wonder if it would be possible to change that
- ship art while sharp and complex, is easily distinguishable
- some effect seem to be better than others,
making you think about prioritizing them if possible
- the grabbers are cute and small, so you aren't too frustrated,
even if they stupidly miss important items
- ship spawning is varied in timing and pattern and not constant,
meaning that bullet burst are unpredictable
- every hit directly impacts score, you are working towards that high-score the entire time,
even if you aren't personally doing anything
- it isn't clear from the start what upgrades you can get, but you know upgrades may matter a lot,
and they are a tangible goal to work towards
- getting more bullets is a very rare, but important event
- slight environmental effects (clouds moving as fast as ships, rain) along with camera shake,
helps immerse the game as a less static thing
- game starts fast and lets you start observing it immediately

things to play with
- more input on "simulation":
    - affect bullet trajectories slightly?
    - affect grabbers slightly?
    - affect ship spawning rates slightly?
    this could potentially make the game a lot more stressful, perhaps in a bad way.
    the game is overstimulating already. the gold ships are perhaps an example of player choice/input,
    which doesn't stress the player bc it is not crucial to keeping score going or anything like that.
    player input should perhaps change impact of simulation, rather than modify the simulation directly
    more input should try not to remove the player's focus on the simulation,
    since that is the interesting part. a way to achieve this could be to have the input
    rely a lot on closely observing patterns in the simulation?
- more immersion
    - lore/text to help you want to work towards another goal than just high score?
    - slower new-game-plus-like progression, could take inspiration from rogue-likes
- more interesting upgrades
    - instead of speed/quantitative upgrades/effects, game could have expensive upgrades that alter game
    behaviour in a significant way
- different rng
    game seems to use pretty "true"/raw pseudorandom numbers for stuff like ship and effect spawning,
    which could be changed to use more smoothed or rigged random numbers
    - ship spawning could vary a little based on active bullets,
    ships destroyed per second etc
    - upgrades could spawn in more predictable patterns for the player to memorize,
    just like certain ship formations
    - grabbers could alter behaviour to work smarter
    OBS: these changes could affect the game a lot,
    slight balancing could improve the tiny important parts
