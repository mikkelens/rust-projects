# rule ideas
- A rank changing its specific value
- Hand levels having different (shuffled) orderings
- Hand levels being coupled together (e.g. Flush always beats Straight, recency priority?)
- Suits modifying their rank scoring (e.g. diamonds are worth 1 more)
- Modifying sets of cards entirely (e.g. face cards, ranges from 3-7, or even more arbitrary)
- Being able to cheat/trick in some limited way (allowed 1 fake card hand as bait)
- Being able to create copies of the same card (? should be accounted for)
- Modifying "meta" rules like player play ordering
